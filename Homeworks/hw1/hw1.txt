Question 1
1. Take the number 7.
2. For an integer  above 1 and below 7:
3. Divide 7 by the integer.
4. Repeat for all integers above 1 and below 7.
5. If one or more of the divisions resulted in an integer quotient:
6. Then 7 is not a prime number.
7. If one or more of the divisions did not result in an integer quotient:
8. Then 7 is a prime number.

Question 2
1. Take a number.
2. For each integer that is above 1 and below the given number:
3. Divide the given number by the integer.
4. Repeat for all integers above 1 and below the given number.
5. If one or more of the divisions resulted in an integer quotient:
6. Then the given number is not a prime number.
7. If one or more of the divisions did not result in an integer quotient:
8. Then the given number is a prime number.

Question 3
1.  Take a word.
2.  Note the number of letters (n) in the word.
3.  If the word has an odd number of letters:
4.  Then the word is not a palindrome.
5.  For each letter in the word:
6.  Note the place value (v) of the letter in the word.
7.  Compare the letter with a letter whose place value in the word is (n+1)-v.
8.  Repeat for the next letter until all letters of the word have been compared.
9.  If all compared numbers are the same:
10. Then the given word is a palendrome.
11. If at least one of the compared letters aren't the same:
12. Then the given word is not a palendrome.

Question 4
1. Take the first card and note its number value.
2. Store the first card's number value as the highest number value.
3. For each card in the stack:
4. Take a card and note its number value.
5. Compare the number value of the card with the current highest number value.
6. If the number value of the card is higher than the current highest number value:
7. Replace and store the current highest number value with the card's number value.
8. Repeat for the next card until all cards in the stack have been checked.

Question 5
1. Take a positive integer and note its value.
2. Find all positive integers below the given integer and note their value.
3. Multiply all of the noted integers together.
